> **Remember that Doktor hasn't brought you or Skitty in to NSFW discussions ever** 
> 1) Unlike Numbuh1 who does not want to get involved, everything that happens in server is my responsibility, even if it is in a section j don't care about. 
- You are explicitly deciding that it is your responsibility to oversee every part of the server. I was under the impression that **@Sublime-Beastars were equal in power and thus equal in responsibility.** Since you are saying that Numbuh1 doesn't want to be involved with other parts of the server then that means it is **NOT** the responsibility of a Sublime Beastar be involved with every section. Being server owner doesn't mean anything unless you are considering deleting the server is a viable power.

> 2) Thus I will pay attention to such area if I see it not resolved cleanly, simply by the fact there conflict growing. After all, Doktor was complaining about woodrider, so I had to take a look due to staff conflicts
-  The discussion just ended by the time you joined. https://discordapp.com/channels/632804599979311144/661996309737373706/681301424390537324
-  Doktor was complaining about Woodrider because **he is a man with a more powerful status making an unsupported argument.** The discussion was going to be fairly academic before Wood decided that his preferences were a definition instead of just preferences for his own comfort rather the streamlining what is already there. (I will talk about the manga-leaks format later in this post)
---  Wood: if im looking at porn i would rather not see something on 4 legs.     https://discordapp.com/channels/632804599979311144/661996309737373706/681251016892743745
-  I would argue that the only person, who wasn't Doktor or Tiyos, who put in an argument that isn't limited to their own prevernces or just agreeing with someone was Mad Brax. The discussion failed because of a lack of valid argument which is unacceptable when handling a subject that many people have strong personal preferences. 
---  He was merely asking Woodrider to step out after stating his opinion (non-argument). Woodrider took a while to do so which gave the impression that Woodrider was claiming that his statement was correct. **I would claim that his status as a @Beastar, makes it more easy to assume this.** 
.


On another note Woodrider confirms that he admins wildkick (thread) https://discordapp.com/channels/632804599979311144/661996309737373706/681525744488415285
- There has been no mention of Woodrider admining wildkick and neither has he put on the mod/admins list in Wildkick (see screenshot in thread). **Suddenly he calls himself admin in this situation.**
-- Next, **AFTER** the demotions he apologizes for his behavior, but tacks on **later that he is still equal with everyone despite being an admin.** https://discordapp.com/channels/632804599979311144/632804599979311146/682912776271953953

> [That] happened to be made by Skitty 
> 1) Then he should have had a convo with Sleepykitty since that was how the guideline was set.

**Reasons why talking to SleepyKitty is inadvisable**
Skitty Anti futa blatant bias. Has stated many times that spoiler tagging certain things was discriminatory, but says this.
> I'm shallow, I find trans material disgusting and would prefer it be spoilered.  Nothing worse than trying to get my rocks off on pornhub and some ugly bitch with a dick is shown in the gay/gay section.

Skitty Presents questionable statements against BBDT and staff without evidence
> Speaking of staff, what even are you?  Do financial contributors now become board members?  Or, as I suspect, did Yy value your input as he did mine and included us in this discussion together?

Skitty telling Tiyos to do the job he is already doing. 
```Mad Brax
but like who wants to moderate that

Sleepykitty
Unfortunately I guess I'd have too since I formulated the idea.

Tiyos
Our stance on extreme fetishes has been made abundantly clear.

Sleepykitty
and it's kind of your job as moderator.
To you know, moderator.
middle paw to Tiyos```

Skitty Doesn't want to work with NSFW in the first place. I doubt that's changed much.
> Nah, I told Yy to remove me from secret police.
> He updated me to see this for Wild Kick news since I used to protect he channel.

> Doktor isn't trying to mold the server into his own preferences, but is trying to streamline our systems and allow the community to grow.

> 1) He admitted it was own preference, which he thinks is best
-   I cannot find anything related to this after searching the key words: "desire", "preference", "prefer", "change", "mold", "I want". **I searched all chats**
> 2) The spoiler system is an example of something that fit him rather than intention, considering the whole thing is at Numbuh1 leisure, who is under no obligation to do the spoilers. Numbuh1 want to see the panic reaction and shares it with the community.
-   There are a **total of two times** Doktor has requested this change
--   Not going to link each quote this segment is small. Exhibit 1: https://discordapp.com/channels/632804599979311144/632804599979311146/677168493031850007
---   Doktor is just talking about streamlining the mobile experience, not just his own experience. He happens to be a user of a mobile device.  
---   Doktor: I’ve heard people request a separate channel quite a lot which is why I bring it up
---   Yy: At same time, I rather not change due to our own culture
----      I do not see how it changes the culture, I think there is a misunderstanding
 ---   Yy: I can see how your idea works.
----      **No conflict at this point.**
--   Numbuh **does not give a response** to this in any staff chats until after the next discussion.  "before: 2020-02-13 from: numbuh1#5964 in: staff-chat " #spoiler-issues doesn't exist yet

--    Exhibit 2: https://discordapp.com/channels/632804599979311144/677776616415297548/682288017393582081
---    Doktor: We wouldn’t have to lock, stuff wouldnt get pushed up by messages, we wouldn’t have to deal with glitchy af pins
----       Statement is about QOL for both mods and users
---    Oric: Have to agree with doktor, reading via pins is a pain in the ass
----       Supporting claim of pins being not optimal
---     Doktor: Lmao I can’t switch between a PowerPoint and discord on my phone without shit breaking
----       This is a comment on the overall usage of multiple applications on mobile device. Phone memory is limited and devices vary in both memory management and capacity.
---    Doktor: With user complaints starting to crop up I feel like there’s no downside to the separate channel now
----       Yes, there are user complaints about the system we have now this is why Doktor wants the server to change. I'd argue that the current system is worse than before since mods can talk during the lock.
---     Note **that after Numbuh makes a statement the problem isn't brought up again.**

```This is also why he wants to make the rules shorter. I've compared to every single one of our networked servers and our rules are at least three times as long as the next largest one in our network 
- while making #overview is fine, is not needed because no one remember the rules, long or short . People always assume they are doing good and only remember if they break it and get slapped by it. 
- it is long so people know the culture
- rules is a reflection of the owner, and I am meticulous person. 
- it was technically sufficient for months anyways```
-- Not much to say about this, rules are confusing and are part of why Lonan was here for so long.
-- Changing them to give us clear leverage is not a bad idea.

```At the end of the day, I may have been harsh on Doktor [I understand more after talking to you] , since unlike Tiyos, there isn't anything explicitly wrong.
It just a combination of following
- my own instincts
- difficulty to work with him with how defensive he gets
- other factor
- Sense he works better as a normal members.
--- for example, people have reported others [Jay]
--- As a Police, he tend to let thing pass that shouldn't, or go harsh without talking [the instant bạn on Ethan]```
ignoring the defensive part since it's generally objective. 

```- Sense he works better as a normal members.
--- for example, people have reported others [Jay]
```
One person has reported Jay, he was going to be removed anyways. The last report about word filter bypass was a very minor infraction

```As a Police, he tend to let thing pass that shouldn't, or go harsh without talking [the instant bạn on Ethan]```
The post rooftop issue was reasonable considering it caused 30 members of our community to leave. We make jokes that they left to go post yiff, but from observing their server, that does not happen.
Ethan would very likely be banned for other things he has said in chat after knowing his attitude. The specific example that Ethan keeps bringing up as a misunderstanding is only one situation out of the many infractions he probably made before we were mods. 
- Merci: "Perm ban Ethan, 3 week temp for whycen"  https://discordapp.com/channels/632804599979311144/632804599979311146/676497549192069129
- This ruling was made under the same amount of evidence that Whycen was banned under. Merci very much agrees with his tempban.


I think that a lot of this "drama" is created from personal biases because people don't know how to work with people who go into a discussion with evidence.
I think this is a low shot, but important. You have given SleepyKitty ***MULTIPLE*** chances at being an admin/mod. Why does he get so much grace when Doktor gets kicked without warning? (I literally can't find any warning that would present the possibility that he would be demoted because of his actions.)

Doktor is a valuable member of the team and he is core to maintaining the communities that many don't want to deal with and finding out which members are causing others to feel uncomfortable. He also has the most experience moderating in other servers.
I would advise you to reconsider the ruling. I would also want you to get Merci's full opinion.
